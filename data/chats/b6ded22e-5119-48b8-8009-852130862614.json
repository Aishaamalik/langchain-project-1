      "content": "Hello there! I'm here to help you with your question. Adding three odd numbers can be a bit tricky, but don't worry, we can do it together! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nTo add three odd numbers, we need to find the sum of each number and then add them together. Here's an example code that shows how to do this:\n```python\n# Add three odd numbers\nodd_numbers = [3, 5, 7]\ntotal = 0\nfor num in odd_numbers:\n    total += num\nprint(\"The sum of the odd numbers is:\", total)\n```\nIn this code, we define an list called `odd_numbers` that contains three odd numbers: 3, 5, and 7. Then, we use a for loop to iterate over each number in the list and add it to a variable called `total`. Finally, we print out the total value of the odd numbers.\n\nLet's try it together! Can you run this code and see what the output is? \ud83d\ude03",
