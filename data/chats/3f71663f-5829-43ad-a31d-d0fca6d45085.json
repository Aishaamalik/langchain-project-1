      "content": "Hello there! I'm here to help you with your question. To add three odd numbers in Python, you can use the `+` operator. Here is an example:\n```\n# Define the three odd numbers you want to add\nnum1 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15\nprint(\"The sum of the three odd numbers is:\", num1)\n```\nIn this code, we define three odd numbers `num1`, `num2`, and `num3` using the variables. Then, we add them together using the `+` operator and print the result to the console.\n\nNote that in Python, you can also use the `sum()` function to add a list of numbers, including odd numbers. Here is an example:\n```\n# Define a list of three odd numbers\nnumbers = [3, 5, 7]\nprint(\"The sum of the three odd numbers is:\", sum(numbers))\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
