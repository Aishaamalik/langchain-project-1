# TODO List for Streaming Response Implementation

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Modified `query_handler.py` to add `generate_streaming_answer` function using Ollama's streaming API
- [x] Updated `app.py` to import the new streaming function
- [x] Replaced non-streaming answer generation with streaming in the chat input handler
- [x] Implemented progressive display of tokens using `st.chat_message` and `st.empty()` for a chat-like appearance
- [x] Added parsing of citations and highlights from the full streamed response
- [x] Ensured the final message is saved to chat history with metadata after streaming completes
- [x] Maintained backward compatibility for error handling

## Completed Tasks (Updated)
- [x] Verified Ollama is installed and llama2 model is available
- [x] Started the Streamlit app successfully at http://localhost:8501

## Testing Instructions
The app is running at http://localhost:8501

To test the streaming functionality:
1. Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser
2. Type a question in the chat input (e.g., "What is machine learning?")
3. Press Enter
4. Observe that the response appears word by word/token by token instead of all at once
5. After the response completes, check that citations and highlights are displayed if applicable

## Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Uncomment the `time.sleep(0.05)` line in app.py for smoother streaming effect

## Notes
- The streaming response now displays token by token/word by word as requested
- Citations and highlights are extracted after the full response is received
- The UI uses Streamlit's chat_message component for a natural chat experience
- Error handling remains intact for cases where streaming fails
